#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, tools and methods to development of high-quality software that meets user needs. It's important in the tech industry because there is need for complex systems that solve probems and software, in conjunction with hardware, is used to create solutions for these problems. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  Development of programming languages in the early 1950's was a key stage in the development of software engineering. Languages such as Fortan were developed then. 
  In the sixties, there came software engineering as a discipline. This encouraged the study of software quality and software engineering became a profession. 
  The next development came in form of structured programming  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requirements; the first phase that documents the users needs and what teh system is required to do.
  Design; is the second phase that has a high level understanding of the system's architecture and the interface for the user.
  Implementation; is the third phase where code is written for the program in regard to the design specifications.
  Testing; this is done in order to ensure that teh software works  as intended and meets the requirements specified.
  Deployment; this phase allows for the software to be made available to customers. 
  Maintenance; this is an ongoing phase that ensures the software is usable and remains running.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall is a step by step methodology and it is used when the suer requirements are static or stable and predictable. The steps follow eachother sequentially, and the deliverable is given to the client once it's all over. 
  Agile is an iterative methodology that is used when the user requirements are unpredictable. the deliverables are given to the clinets in multiple steps in orderto ensure that their needs are met.
  Waterfall methodology can be used to when the system or program to be created is simple and straightforward. Agile is used when the suer needs are not fixed and the project might be a little more complex. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  A software developer writes code for the program to be created. 
  An assurance engineer runs testing to ensure the deliverables being created are of high quality and they work to ensure that the program works as it's supposed to.
  Project managers work to oversee the projects from beginning to end, and ensure they are completed on time and within budget. They are the link between the team and the stakeholders.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated development environments are software packages thata re used to write, debug and test code and an example of this is PyCharm. 
  Version Control Systems are meant to keep track of the different changes to code, especially in collaborative environments. An example of this is Git.
  
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Some of the challenges faced include changes in user needs. This makes the development process slower and can create an unintentional increase in scope, ie, scope creep. The project manager needs to ensure that the tasks provided to the software engineers are within previously discussed scope and the user needs don't change at inappropriate times.
  Technical debt comes up as a s reuslt of the long term use of shortcuts and lack of following proper frameworks for the creation of architecture which makes maintenance expensive and difficult. To reduce technical debt, then ensuring that shortcuts are discouraged and used less often.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit testing allows for testing of individual modules of the software created.
  Integration testing allows for testing of the inetractions between the various modules and other subsystems
  System testing works to test the system as a whole 
  Acceptance testing is to ensure the software meets users needs.
  All these tests are important in order to ensure that the shiftware provided is working and it meets the needs specified in the requirements phase.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the process of creating clear, concise prompts for getting the best possible answers from AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  A vague prompt is "Please explain string theory"
  A specific, clear and concise prompt is "Please explain what string theory is, how it works and the challenges facing the theory's validation. Please use a simple explanation, as if you are explaining it to a 14 year old high school student."
  The latter prompt is more effective because it narrows down a very broad topic and it makes the level of explanation needed even clearer.
